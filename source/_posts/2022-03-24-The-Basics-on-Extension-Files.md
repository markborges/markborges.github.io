**Business Central** Application Files are a complex entity that encapsulates tons of information in it, including its Name, Publisher, Version, App Id, along with its own _Source Code_.

The purpose of this post, is to just slightly dissect an **.App** file, to show what you can look for when downloading Third Party **.App** files from the internet, such as all the Apps on this website.

When you try to Upload an Extension using the **Extension Management** in BC, once you select the **.App** file, BC will provide you with a lot of information that developers made available when they compiled (aka packaged) the application.
