Well, since I started writing the post on [**BC 20 Upgrades**](/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/), **Microsoft** has added a few items to the list. 😵
<!--more-->

So far, there's only one new feature that really caught my attention:

---
# (Order Processing) [Release and reopen multiple documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/release-reopen-multiple-documents)
🟡 **Late comer** 🟡: *this feature is not being delivered in **April**. Instead, this will be delivered in **May**, 2022*

BC will now support bulk Release and Reopen of documents, something that many customers have long requested. 🍾🥂🍾

I'll be adding more items to the list, if **Microsoft** keeps on improving the list of planned features. 🍻
