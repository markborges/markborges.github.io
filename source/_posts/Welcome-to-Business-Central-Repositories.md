I have taken some time in the past 4 days to setup this website, and even though I'm struggling a little bit with this [Hexo](https://hexo.io) framework, I'm still very grateful it exists. I didn't know setting up an ad-free blog was so hard! ü•µ

Anyway, welcome to my website, **Business Central Repositories**, where I'll be sharing a little bit of Functional content, a little bit of Technical content, and hopefully, a lot of Business Central Extensions to make our lives easier.

The best way to get familiar with my website is to review the following sections:
* [**About**](/About): I took some time writing the About page to explain a little more about this Website: The motivation, the purpose, how I'll be publishing content on it and how I envision it being sourced by the Business Central community.
* [**Bio**](/About/#The%20Author): I also took some time writing a short (and a long ü•¥) bio about me, so please check it out to know a bit more of who I am, and how I got involved with Navision and Microsoft Business Central.
* [**Disclaimer**](/Disclaimer): Before downloading any extensions from this Website, please review the Disclaimer section. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:markborges@gmail.com) ‚úç if you have any questions. 
* [**Coming Soon**](/categories/Coming-Soon): Check out the latest post on the Coming Soon category to see what I'm currently working on, and what will be published next

Thanks for visiting! üòé üçª
