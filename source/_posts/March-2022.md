During March 2022, I want to be working on the following topics.

<!--more-->
# Functional Blog
⚫ **Effective Permissions**: An out-of-box solution to help troubleshooting user permissions
🟢 **BC 20 Upgrades (aka BC 2022 Wave 1)**: I want to highlight some nice features from [BC 20](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/), that are slated to come this April. This post has 2 parts, since Microsoft is increasing the list of features that will be released. [**Part 1**](/2022/03/24/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/), [**Part 2**](/2022/03/24/BC-20-Upgrades-Part-2/)

# Technical Blog
🟡 **The Basics About an Extension File**: I want to give a few pointers on how to critically analyze an Extension .App file, before installing it into your environments
⚫ **OAuth Authentication**: I want to learn more about the OAuth authentication that will replace the old Web Services keys, and I want to share my findings with you

# Repositories
🟢 [**Advanced Find Entries**](/2022/03/16/Advanced-Find-Entries/): Based on [this BC Idea](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=173910b8-fdae-ea11-8b71-0003ff68f609), this will be an extension that lets users search for Document Nos. in multiple fields of the same table. When setup properly, this can end up being a full-text search tool.
🟡 **Undo Posted Transfer Shipments**: Based on [this BC Idea](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=458b33be-5cf7-e911-b862-0003ff68ac6b), this will be an extension that will allow Posted Transfer Shipments to be undone, if they haven't been received yet.
⚫ **Return-from Fields on Sales Return Orders**: Based on [this BC Idea](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=46105865-7f10-e911-9461-0003ff68e0da), this will be an extension made to allow users to select a different Ship-to Address when returning goods.
🟡 **Mass Upload of Attachments**: A tool for mass uploading attachments to different Master Data records, at once.
