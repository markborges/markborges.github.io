## Longer Bio... Prior to Navision

Hi again! Originally from Brazil, I consider myself fortunate that my parents were able to bring a computer home in the early 90's, when I was 7 years old. Computers were not readily available in Brazil until the late 90's, when prices started to become more accessible.

I've always been interested on how things were made, and when I got a chance of playing with computers, I was always very interested in how computer programs (and games üòù) worked. At age of 11, I had already been playing with [dBase III Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) (a computer system that already had the concepts Business Central has like Tables, Forms and Reports), when a friend of the family briefly showed me how to take that dBase source code and write it in [Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)), and compile it into an .EXE file. From that day on, my mind was permanently blown üò≤.

I started finding all the different reasons to try to write programs. And the more data I could store about different entities, the happier I'd be ü§ì. I wrote multiple pizza-order-taking software, VHS-rental software, software for my mom and my dad to work with on their businesses. My dad encouraged me by gifting me programming books, and my mom probably passed this programming gene to me by DNA, as she had taken a [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol) course (in a paper-only format!) years prior to having me.

Fast forward a few years, I got my hands on C, C++ and mostly on [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), which had an easier way to connect to Databases.

At age 14, I took a computer programming course on Databases and Data Modeling, which finally gave me some understanding on how data was stored and how entities (tables) related on different computer systems.

While exploring Visual Basic, I got in touch with [Microsoft Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access) for creating Databases, but I never actually had programmed in it until a few years later, when my mom needed some piece of software to help her manage her Real Estate business. She needed an integrated software to control tenants, landlords, accounts payable and receivable, as well as receipt and check printing. And that was the very first mini-ERP that I had written from scratch. (P.S.: This software still lives, by the way, and I have tried multiple times to upgrade to newer technologies, but the users never adopted -- tell me about users who don't want to upgrade their systems! üòÖ)

At around the same time, I went to college for Computer Science, and that's when my knowledge in computer systems (and other areas in IT) multiplied infinitely. I had a chance of diving deep into programing languages and its basics, programing structures, database systems, computer systems, and even operating systems and compilers.

Theeeeen... on my last year of college, I had been presented with an internship offer to learn "a new programming language" that was not very popular in Brazil, for one month, and after that, I was going to work with that programming language as a developer in implementation projects. The year was 2005, and that was the first time ever, that I had heard about Microsoft Business Solutions - Navision. I got my hands on it, when it was on version 3.7 in Brazil.

And that's when my love life begins with Navision...

## Longer Bio... from Navision to BC

As mentioned, I started working as a developer, a.k.a. a Technical Consultant, for a consulting company in Brazil. I was given that Navision 3.7 blue binder book, which had all the intricacies of Navision and C/AL at the time. I was given 1 month to learn the basics, to explore the system, and then to start programing with it. At first, Navision C/AL's was a very odd programming language to me, since I was coming from languages such as Clipper, Visual Basic, Java and C. I had learned C/AL was based in Pascal, but Pascal has never been in my repertoire before.

With time, however, I started enjoying Navision's structure a lot: Reading and writing records to the database was pretty straight forward. All the helper functions that makes C/AL for what it is, made the writing of Business Applications pretty easy and rapid. With time, I thought of writing all the systems I had ever written (including my mom's Real Estate software), using Navision and C/AL, but unfortunately, licensing was an issue that did not allow me to deploy any of my creations.

I started enjoying the consulting life, as it was really fun to work on multiple industries and daily routines at the same time. As a technical consultant, however, my experiences were a bit more shielded by the leading functional consultant, and I didn't get much customer-facing interaction as I would like (one bad stereotype I had from Computer Science students, was that they were all too much into their computers and had little to no social interactions -- I didn't want that to myself). With time, I had shown my boss, and my functional consultant peers that I was able of doing more than just developing...

As I got more familiar with the Navision Application itself (rather than just the C/AL language), whenever I got the functional design documents, I would put some critical thinking into it before jumping into development. I had received some nice documents to work on, but at the same time, I had received some very bad documents. Some functional documents would clearly state how they wanted Navision to work, and with what I knew from behind the scenes, that could cause some disasters in some areas of the system. Of course, I was not immune to disasters at all, some even caused by my own inexperieced self, of course, but with time and experience piling up, I was able to avoid issues more and more.

I also got known to test my developments more thoroughly, which rendered less back-and-forth between me, the functional and the end-user. It was just a matter of time, that I started actually participating more and more on customer facing activities.

2007 came, I was recently out of college living in S√£o Paulo (one of the busiest cities in Latin America), when I decided I wanted to live with more quality of life. With this, I moved to Curitiba, in the south of Brazil, and unfortunately, there were absolutely zero opportunities of working in Navision in that part of the country. I needed to go back to old Visual Basic development, and I was part of the team that developed the Payroll System of Curitiba's City Hall. A few months after that, I was able to get some experience with C# and ASP.NET, since the city was modernizing some of its systems. My life in Curitiba didn't last long...

Early 2008, one of the Navision customers for my previous consulting job, had contacted me, offering a job to be an admin for their Navision 3.7 system. Even though I loved the quality of life in Curitiba, I dropped everything, and took this chance back, now in the countryside of S√£o Paulo state (which was not as hectic as S√£o Paulo city). I was so happy to be back to working with Nav, but this time, I was not supposed to develop. As a system adminitrator, I was now in charge of handling users (bugs, issues, training, permissions, etc...), and there was a team in Switzerland who was responsible for any developments and improvements needed.

For those who had worked with Brazil before, Brazil is crazy regulated by laws, and Navision
