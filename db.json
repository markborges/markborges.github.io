Website\n\n## The Motivation\nAs you'll read in my bio, I'm very passionate about ERP systems in general. Even before I started working with Navision, I already had some deep curiosity and appreciation for complex and integrated computer systems, which later in college, I learned they were called ERP systems (for those not familiar with the acronym, it stands for **E**nterprise **R**esource **P**lanning).\n\nNavision Blogs and Community Webistes have had a big impact in my professional life, as they were my immediate source of help for issues that I found on my first years of developing in Nav. On my first Nav job (in which I had been hired to learn Nav from scratch for a month, and then to be thrown right into projects), one of the first help references my boss had provided me, was Luc Van Dyck's [Mibuso](https://mibuso.com/) website.\n\nFor years, [Mibuso](https://mibuso.com/) was what it claimed to be at the time: _My favorite knowledge base_. I had spent a lot of time researching on their forums, and also contributing myself. The [Downloads](https://forum.mibuso.com/categories/downloads) sections was one of my favorite ones: to explore how other developers were being creative with Nav.\n\nWith time, I learned about other community websites such as Erik P Ernst's \"[Dynamics User Group](https://www.dynamicsuser.net/)\", Alex Chow's \"[Confessions of a Nav Consultant](https://www.dynamicsnavconsultant.com/)\", Olof Simren's [Blog](https://www.olofsimren.com/) and few partner websites with constant blog posts about different topics.\n\nI've always appreciated the work put in by these guys and the whole community: sharing their knowledge in exchange for nothing. And now, as I'm feeling more ready than ever, and I'm missing being a developer (read my [bio](#Short-Bio) for details), and with an ever growing will to share all the knowledge I had acquired, I decided to start this website, in which I shall be sharing 3 types of contents:\n* Full Open-Source Business Central Extensions\n* Functional Blog Entries\n* Technical Blog Entries\n\nKeep reading, and you'll understand more of my idea for this website...\n\n## The Purpose\nThe #1 purpose of this website, from which its name originated, is to keep a **curated** repository of Business Central extensions.\n\nI also plan on sharing Blog entries with both Functional and Technical contents. \n\nBecause the [Publishing Process](#The-Publishing-Process) may take some time to conclude, I will also be keeping a section called [\"Coming Soon\"](/categories/Coming-Soon/) to list which posts are currently on the works, and which ones are coming next.\n\nBy the way, I will be keeping this website on my free-time, therefore, I may be moving slow at times, so bear with me 😅.\n\n## The Publishing Process\nHaving a curated repository means that I will personally engage with the developers, to review the contents of their extensions, in order to understand:\n* What it does,\n* What is the business value behind it,\n* And what are the risks and possible harms of each extension\n\nThis assessment shall be done prior to publishing on the website, so that anyone downloading these Extensions can make an informed decision before downloading and/or installing them. **However, 🛑🛑🛑 please review the [Disclaimer](/Disclaimer) section** 🛑🛑🛑 to understand your liabilities if you choose to install these Extensions.\n\n## Community Sourced\nMy idea is to share contents from the Business Central community: Independent developers, independent consultants, end users and anybody else who identifies as part of this big community.\n\nFor **Blog Entries**, I intend on writing posts myself, but I also intend on looking for other contributors who would like a space to share their ideas and challenges regarding the functional and technical sides of Business Central. I will also look for contributors from which I can acquire ideas and expand them.\n\nFor the **Repositories**, in the beginning I will be posting most of my own developements based on:\n* Struggles I currently have at work\n* Ideas posted on the Microsoft [Ideas](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/categories/?forum=e288ef32-82ed-e611-8101-5065f38b21f1&forumName=Dynamics%20365%20Business%20Central) Website that were never picked up\n* Ideas posted on other community websites\n* Contributors\n\nJust like the Blog Entries, I will also be looking for independent developers who would like to submit their own Extensions, and, I will be looking for solutions that other developers implemented who are willing to share with us.\n\nAny time I use an idea already existing in the community, you shall find a link/reference to the original content, or a reference to the Author's name.\n\nIf you already have ideas of things to share, please [contact me](mailto:markborges@gmail.com) ✍🙂\n\n## Why is Commenting and Searching Disabled\nI'm still getting familiar with this blog framework, and so far, I haven't been able to enable commenting on my blog posts. Search is also still in progress. 😬\n\n---\n\n# The Author\n## Short Bio\n![Marcelo Borges](/PAF/Marcelo-Borges.jpg)\n\nHi! I'm **Marcelo Borges**. A developer at heart and an ERP enthusiast, I'm a Technical Consultant turned into a very passionate Functional Consultant.\n\nI have been working with Microsoft Business Central and its former versions since 2005. I have experienced Business Central in both sides of the table: as a System Administrator in an end-user company, and as consultant for Microsoft Partners who resells Business Central.\n\nAs of March 2022, I have been working as a Functional Consultant, in New York City, for an American consulting company for almost 5 years now. My primary role is Solution Architect, where I bring my almost-20-years of Technical/Functional expertise into my projects. My focus is mainly on Sales and Purchasing, Inventory, Warehouse Management, Manufacturing and 3rd Party Shipping Solutions. The type of challenges I like most is implementing Business Central on companies with challenging Warehouse scenarios: RF Guns, multiple shipping solutions, and inefficient processes.\n\nAmong other non-computer-related hobbies (🚲🏃‍♂️🏐✈💤🏞), I 💗 love 💗 to develop on my free time, which is going to be serving as some fuel to this website.\n\n## Longer Bio\n\nHi again! Originally from Brazil, I got into computer systems at a very young age. At age 11, I had already been playing around with a Database Management system called [dBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase), which had Tables, Forms and Reports, just like Business Central. When a friend of the family briefly introduced me on how to write actual .EXE files to run in MS-DOS, my mind was permanently blown 😯!\n\n![dBase III Plus](/PAF/About-dBase.PNG)\n\nFrom that day on, I got more and more into computer systems and databases (I was self-taught in some of them), and with a lot of free time, I had a lot creativity to channel through different programming languages 🤓. Until I reached Navision, I had already played with dBase, Clipper, Visual Basic, C, C++, MS-Access, Java, SQL and Oracle Databases (aside from a few other minor languages I saw in college). I had also developed a mini-ERP for my mom's business in Real Estate management.\n\nIn 2005, 1 year prior to my graduation in Computer Science college, I was offered an internship opportunity to learn \"a new language\" that was not very famous in Brazil. While all my classmates sought after popular programming languages (like Java, C/C++, .NET, etc), I decided to gamble a little and spend some time at this company learning this unknown language. Well, this unknown language happened to be Navision's C/AL 😯.\n\nI worked as a full-time intern for one year, until graduation, when this consulting company decided to hire me as an employee. I worked with them for another year, as a technical consultant, learning a lot of the backstage of Navision, in many different industries and projects. With all the experience I grabbed from my functional colleagues, I had also acquired some solid knowledge in the most commonly used areas of Navision 3.7.\n\n![Navision 3.7](/PAF/About-NAV37.gif)\n\nIn 2007, I took a break from Navision, as I needed to move towns in Brazil, in search for quality of life. The city I had moved to, had zero opportunities with Navision, and that kind of upset me, as I had really gotten into it. However, in early 2008, one of the customers for the consulting company that I had worked for, contacted me, offering a job as their Nav System Administrator. Even though I loved the new city I was living in, I loved that job offer more, and it didn't take me long to say yes to that opportunity.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2013 I worked with this company mainly as a System Administrator (apart from becoming an IT Manager for a couple of years), but with time, I became part of their global Nav development team. I was given leeway to exercise both Functional and Technical work in their Navision system. Their main Nav partner was based in Germany (as the company was a Swiss company), but we also had our local Brazilian partner. Since Brazilian businesses are crazy regulated by law, it had a lot of local requirements. At some point, we needed to remove the Brazilian localization from Navision and we needed to integrate it with a local software that would take care of all the invoicing process and tax reporting to the government.\n\n**_Fun fact_: towards the end of 2011, due to the complexities in Brazilian laws, Microsoft decided to abandon their investments in Navision for Brazil, and they channeled all their energy to our rich cousin, Axapta -- It was not until recently that they decided to officially bring Brazil back into their catalog of official localizations. 🎉**\n\nDuring that System Administrator and Global Developer job, I participated in some of their big moves in their own Navision realm: Migration from their old FDB databases to SQL Databases, and to Migrate from Nav 3.7 to Nav 2009 R2. They also had their very own Manufaturing customization (it could almost be seen as a full fledged ISV) that was rolled out to 27 countries, and every 3 months, we had Service Pack projects to deploy all the latest fixes and feature improvements to all 27 countries. That was a VERY fun job that I really loved a lot 💖.\n\nFor not so fun reasons, I needed to change jobs in 2013, and I went back to the consulting side of the table. This time, I had joined the company that used to be responsible for the official Brazilian localization back when Microsoft still supported Navision. This time, I was hired to be a developer for the support team. Even though Microsoft halted most Navision initiatives, we were still allowed to do Navision business with companies that already used Navision, and, branches of worldwide companies that had Navision on their headquarters.\n\nTherefore, there was, still, a LOT of work in terms of Brazilian localization. I worked with this consulting company for over a year, and I supported many of their different customers and industries, bringing them all my functional and development expertise, mixed in with thorough testing and detailed documentation. Towards the end of my time there, they were also assigning me to a few implementation projects that were in need of a seasoned developer.\n\nIn the end of 2014, I landed a job opportunity in New York City, for a French cosmetics brand that used Navision 2009 R2 as their ERP. Again, I was being brought back to the End User/System Admin/Inhouse Developer side of the table, in another company with offices in multiple countries, and it was for the best: it was in this company that I acquired all of my knowledge in Logistics and Operations. This company had some of the best ISVs for Receiving, Shipping and EDI in the market at the time, but they had very poor systematic processes. Their experience with Navision was very limited, and I saw right off the gate that they were not using it properly. I saw this great opportunity to start improving processes, and to start seeing some real improvements on their overall operations. Even thought they did not use Navision in their headquartes in France, they did use it in Asia as well. I oversaw their asian Navision operations for a year until they were able to hire a (great) resource to do what I did in the U.S..\n\nThis all brings me to mid-2017, when the current company that I work for, contacted me in search for a functional consultant with experience in ISVs I mentioned before. For the first time, I was hired to officially be a Functional Consultant, but they knew that I had tons of Navision development experience as well. I had been assigned to each and every one of my projects, as a functional consultant, and little by little, whenever possible, I tried to sprinkle some of my development experience here and there.\n\nTruthfully, there were times I was forbidden to develop 😅, but with time and trust, I got the leeway to develop more freely. In some projects, Project Managers wouldn't want me to develop at all, but once they saw the benefits of having one person tackling some complex-issues with less back-and-forth between multiple parties (tech-func-customer), they started allowing me to do it a bit more.\n\nI started getting into Business Central AL Extensions from the beginning, since I didn't want to lose touch with it, but, I'm still always assigned as a functional consultant to my projects, and I still always work closely to the lead developers in each project.\n\nEven with the few opportunities I get to develop at work, I still miss developing a lot 💔, so that's one of the reasons why I'm bringing Business Central Repositories to life! ⭐\n\nI hope you enjoy it! 🍻\n\n---\n__** Credits to Images:__\n- dBase: https://winworldpc.com/product/dbase/iii-plus-v11\n- Navision 3.7: https://mibuso.com/downloads/microsoft-business-solutions-navision-w1-370a\n\n---\n\n_Last Updated: Mar, 13th, 2022_","source":"About/index.md","raw":"---\ntitle: About Business Central Repositories\ndate: 2022-03-12 18:56:32\n---\n# This Website\n\n## The Motivation\nAs you'll read in my bio, I'm very passionate about ERP systems in general.

On my first Nav job (in which I had been hired to learn Nav from scratch for a month, and then to be thrown right into projects), one of the first help references my boss had provided me, was Luc Van Dyck's [Mibuso](https://mibuso.com/) website.\n\nFor years, [Mibuso](https://mibuso.com/) was what it claimed to be at the time: _My favorite knowledge base_.

I’m <strong>Marcelo Borges</strong>. A developer at heart and an ERP enthusiast, I’m a Technical Consultant turned into a very passionate Functional Consultant.</p>\n<p>I have been working with Microsoft Business Central and its former versions since 2005. I have experienced Business Central in both sides of the table: as a System Administrator in an end-user company, and as consultant for Microsoft Partners who resells Business Central.</p>\n<p>As of March 2022, I have been working as a Functional Consultant, in New York City, for an American consulting company for almost 5 years now. My primary role is Solution Architect, where I bring my almost-20-years of Technical&#x2F;Functional expertise into my projects. My focus is mainly on Sales and Purchasing, Inventory, Warehouse Management, Manufacturing and 3rd Party Shipping Solutions. The type of challenges I like most is implementing Business Central on companies with challenging Warehouse scenarios: RF Guns, multiple shipping solutions, and inefficient processes.</p>\n<p>Among other non-computer-related hobbies (🚲🏃‍♂️🏐✈💤🏞), I 💗 love 💗 to develop on my free time, which is going to be serving as some fuel to this website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Longer-Bio\"><a href=\"#Longer-Bio\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Longer Bio\"></a>Longer Bio</h2><p>Hi again! Originally from Brazil, I got into computer systems at a very young age. At age 11, I had already been playing around with a Database Management system called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase\">dBase</a>, which had Tables, Forms and Reports, just like Business Central. When a friend of the family briefly introduced me on how to write actual .EXE files to run in MS-DOS, my mind was permanently blown 😯!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/PAF/About-dBase.PNG\" alt=\"dBase III Plus\"><span class=\"image-caption\">dBase III Plus</span></p>\n<p>From that day on, I got more and more into computer systems and databases (I was self-taught in some of them), and with a lot of free time, I had a lot creativity to channel through different programming languages 🤓. Until I reached Navision, I had already played with dBase, Clipper, Visual Basic, C, C++, MS-Access, Java, SQL and Oracle Databases (aside from a few other minor languages I saw in college). I had also developed a mini-ERP for my mom’s business in Real Estate management.</p>\n<p>In 2005, 1 year prior to my graduation in Computer Science college, I was offered an internship opportunity to learn “a new language” that was not very famous in Brazil. While all my classmates sought after popular programming languages (like Java, C&#x2F;C++, .NET, etc), I decided to gamble a little and spend some time at this company learning this unknown language. Well, this unknown language happened to be Navision’s C&#x2F;AL 😯.</p>\n<p>I worked as a full-time intern for one year, until graduation, when this consulting company decided to hire me as an employee. I worked with them for another year, as a technical consultant, learning a lot of the backstage of Navision, in many different industries and projects. With all the experience I grabbed from my functional colleagues, I had also acquired some solid knowledge in the most commonly used areas of Navision 3.7.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/PAF/About-NAV37.gif\" alt=\"Navision 3.7\"><span class=\"image-caption\">Navision 3.7</span></p>\n<p>In 2007, I took a break from Navision, as I needed to move towns in Brazil, in search for quality of life. The city I had moved to, had zero opportunities with Navision, and that kind of upset me, as I had really gotten into it. However, in early 2008, one of the customers for the consulting company that I had worked for, contacted me, offering a job as their Nav System Administrator. Even though I loved the new city I was living in, I loved that job offer more, and it didn’t take me long to say yes to that opportunity.</p>\n<p>From 2008 to 2013 I worked with this company mainly as a System Administrator (apart from becoming an IT Manager for a couple of years), but with time, I became part of their global Nav development team. I was given leeway to exercise both Functional and Technical work in their Navision system. Their main Nav partner was based in Germany (as the company was a Swiss company), but we also had our local Brazilian partner. Since Brazilian businesses are crazy regulated by law, it had a lot of local requirements. At some point, we needed to remove the Brazilian localization from Navision and we needed to integrate it with a local software that would take care of all the invoicing process and tax reporting to the government.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fun fact</em>: towards the end of 2011, due to the complexities in Brazilian laws, Microsoft decided to abandon their investments in Navision for Brazil, and they channeled all their energy to our rich cousin, Axapta – It was not until recently that they decided to officially bring Brazil back into their catalog of official localizations. 🎉</strong></p>\n<p>During that System Administrator and Global Developer job, I participated in some of their big moves in their own Navision realm: Migration from their old FDB databases to SQL Databases, and to Migrate from Nav 3.7 to Nav 2009 R2. They also had their very own Manufaturing customization (it could almost be seen as a full fledged ISV) that was rolled out to 27 countries, and every 3 months, we had Service Pack projects to deploy all the latest fixes and feature improvements to all 27 countries. That was a VERY fun job that I really loved a lot 💖.</p>\n<p>For not so fun reasons, I needed to change jobs in 2013, and I went back to the consulting side of the table. This time, I had joined the company that used to be responsible for the official Brazilian localization back when Microsoft still supported Navision. This time, I was hired to be a developer for the support team. Even though Microsoft halted most Navision initiatives, we were still allowed to do Navision business with companies that already used Navision, and, branches of worldwide companies that had Navision on their headquarters.</p>\n<p>Therefore, there was, still, a LOT of work in terms of Brazilian localization. I worked with this consulting company for over a year, and I supported many of their different customers and industries, bringing them all my functional and development expertise, mixed in with thorough testing and detailed documentation. Towards the end of my time there, they were also assigning me to a few implementation projects that were in need of a seasoned developer.</p>\n<p>In the end of 2014, I landed a job opportunity in New York City, for a French cosmetics brand that used Navision 2009 R2 as their ERP. Again, I was being brought back to the End User&#x2F;System Admin&#x2F;Inhouse Developer side of the table, in another company with offices in multiple countries, and it was for the best: it was in this company that I acquired all of my knowledge in Logistics and Operations. This company had some of the best ISVs for Receiving, Shipping and EDI in the market at the time, but they had very poor systematic processes. Their experience with Navision was very limited, and I saw right off the gate that they were not using it properly. I saw this great opportunity to start improving processes, and to start seeing some real improvements on their overall operations. Even thought they did not use Navision in their headquartes in France, they did use it in Asia as well. I oversaw their asian Navision operations for a year until they were able to hire a (great) resource to do what I did in the U.S..</p>\n<p>This all brings me to mid-2017, when the current company that I work for, contacted me in search for a functional consultant with experience in ISVs I mentioned before. For the first time, I was hired to officially be a Functional Consultant, but they knew that I had tons of Navision development experience as well. I had been assigned to each and every one of my projects, as a functional consultant, and little by little, whenever possible, I tried to sprinkle some of my development experience here and there.</p>\n<p>Truthfully, there were times I was forbidden to develop 😅, but with time and trust, I got the leeway to develop more freely. In some projects, Project Managers wouldn’t want me to develop at all, but once they saw the benefits of having one person tackling some complex-issues with less back-and-forth between multiple parties (tech-func-customer), they started allowing me to do it a bit more.</p>\n<p>I started getting into Business Central AL Extensions from the beginning, since I didn’t want to lose touch with it, but, I’m still always assigned as a functional consultant to my projects, and I still always work closely to the lead developers in each project.</p>\n<p>Even with the few opportunities I get to develop at work, I still miss developing a lot 💔, so that’s one of the reasons why I’m bringing Business Central Repositories to life! ⭐</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! 🍻</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>** Credits to Images:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>dBase: <a href=\"https://winworldpc.com/product/dbase/iii-plus-v11\">https://winworldpc.com/product/dbase/iii-plus-v11</a></li>\n<li>Navision 3.7: <a href=\"https://mibuso.com/downloads/microsoft-business-solutions-navision-w1-370a\">https://mibuso.com/downloads/microsoft-business-solutions-navision-w1-370a</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Last Updated: Mar, 13th, 2022</em></p>\n<hr><div style=\"text-align:center;border:1px black solid;background-color:#e6fdff;font-size:0.9em\"><span class=\"post-meta-item\"></span></div>","site":{"data":{"styles":"img {\n  border: 1px solid #d3d3d3;\n}\n.post-body img {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n","variables":""}},"length":10930,"excerpt":"","more":"<h1 id=\"This-Website\"><a href=\"#This-Website\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"This Website\"></a>This Website</h1><h2 id=\"The-Motivation\"><a href=\"#The-Motivation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Motivation\"></a>The Motivation</h2><p>As you’ll read in my bio, I’m very passionate about ERP systems in general. Even before I started working with Navision, I already had some deep curiosity and appreciation for complex and integrated computer systems, which later in college, I learned they were called ERP systems (for those not familiar with the acronym, it stands for <strong>E</strong>nterprise <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>P</strong>lanning).</p>\n<p>Navision Blogs and Community Webistes have had a big impact in my professional life, as they were my immediate source of help for issues that I found on my first years of developing in Nav. On my first Nav job (in which I had been hired to learn Nav from scratch for a month, and then to be thrown right into projects), one of the first help references my boss had provided me, was Luc Van Dyck’s <a href=\"https://mibuso.com/\">Mibuso</a> website.</p>\n<p>For years, <a href=\"https://mibuso.com/\">Mibuso</a> was what it claimed to be at the time: <em>My favorite knowledge base</em>. I had spent a lot of time researching on their forums, and also contributing myself. The <a href=\"https://forum.mibuso.com/categories/downloads\">Downloads</a> sections was one of my favorite ones: to explore how other developers were being creative with Nav.</p>\n<p>With time, I learned about other community websites such as Erik P Ernst’s “<a href=\"https://www.dynamicsuser.net/\">Dynamics User Group</a>“, Alex Chow’s “<a href=\"https://www.dynamicsnavconsultant.com/\">Confessions of a Nav Consultant</a>“, Olof Simren’s <a href=\"https://www.olofsimren.com/\">Blog</a> and few partner websites with constant blog posts about different topics.</p>\n<p>I’ve always appreciated the work put in by these guys and the whole community: sharing their knowledge in exchange for nothing.

Prior to Navision\n\nHi again! Originally from Brazil, I consider myself fortunate that my parents were able to bring a computer home in the early 90's, when I was 7 years old. Computers were not readily available in Brazil until the late 90's, when prices started to become more accessible.\n\nI've always been interested on how things were made, and when I got a chance of playing with computers, I was always very interested in how computer programs (and games 😝) worked. At age of 11, I had already been playing with [dBase III Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) (a computer system that already had the concepts Business Central has like Tables, Forms and Reports), when a friend of the family briefly showed me how to take that dBase source code and write it in [Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)), and compile it into an .EXE file. From that day on, my mind was permanently blown 😲.\n\n![dBase III Plus](PAF/About-dBase.PNG)\n\nI started finding all the different reasons to try to write programs. And the more data I could store about different entities, the happier I'd be 🤓. I wrote multiple pizza-order-taking software, VHS-rental software, software for my mom and my dad to work with on their businesses. My dad encouraged me by gifting me programming books, and my mom probably passed this programming gene to me by DNA, as she had taken a [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol) course (in a paper-only format!) years prior to having me.\n\nFast forward a few years, I got my hands on C, C++ and mostly on [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), which had an easier way to connect to Databases.\n\n![A screenshot of Visual Basic 6.0 running on Windows XP](PAF/About-VB6.PNG)\n\nAt age 14, I took a computer programming course on Databases and Data Modeling, which finally gave me some understanding on how data was stored and how entities (tables) related on different computer systems.\n\nWhile exploring Visual Basic, I got in touch with [Microsoft Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access) for creating Databases, but I never actually had programmed in it until a few years later, when my mom needed some piece of software to help her manage her Real Estate business. She needed an integrated software to control tenants, landlords, accounts payable and receivable, as well as receipt and check printing. And that was the very first mini-ERP that I had written from scratch. (P.S.: This software still lives, by the way, and I have tried multiple times to upgrade to newer technologies, but the users never adopted -- tell me about users who don't want to upgrade their systems! 😅)\n\nAt around the same time, I went to college for Computer Science, and that's when my knowledge in computer systems (and other areas in IT) multiplied infinitely. I had a chance of diving deep into programing languages and its basics, programing structures, database systems, computer systems, and even operating systems and compilers.\n\nTheeeeen... on my last year of college, I had been presented with an internship offer to learn \"a new programming language\" that was not very popular in Brazil, for one month, and after that, I was going to work with that programming language as a developer in implementation projects. The year was 2005, and that was the first time ever, that I had heard about Microsoft Business Solutions - Navision. I got my hands on it, when it was on version 3.7 in Brazil.\n\nAnd that's when my love life begins with Navision...\n\n## Longer Bio... from Navision to BC\n\nAs mentioned, I started working as a developer, a.k.a. a Technical Consultant, for a consulting company in Brazil. I was given that Navision 3.7 blue binder book, which had all the intricacies of Navision and C/AL at the time. I was given 1 month to learn the basics, to explore the system, and then to start programing with it. At first, Navision C/AL's was a very odd programming language to me, since I was coming from languages such as Clipper, Visual Basic, Java and C. I had learned C/AL was based in Pascal, but Pascal has never been in my repertoire before.\n\n![A screenshot of Free Pascal 3.2](PAF/About-Pascal.png)\n\nWith time, however, I started enjoying Navision's structure a lot: Reading and writing records to the database was pretty straight forward. All the helper functions that makes C/AL for what it is, made the writing of Business Applications pretty easy and rapid. With time, I thought of writing all the systems I had ever written (including my mom's Real Estate software), using Navision and C/AL, but unfortunately, licensing was an issue that did not allow me to deploy any of my creations.\n\nI started enjoying the consulting life, as it was really fun to work on multiple industries and daily routines at the same time. As a technical consultant, however, my experiences were a bit more shielded by the leading functional consultant, and I didn't get much customer-facing interaction as I would like (one bad stereotype I had from Computer Science students, was that they were all too much into their computers and had little to no social interactions -- I didn't want that to myself). With time, I had shown my boss, and my functional consultant peers that I was able of doing more than just developing...\n\nAs I got more familiar with the Navision Application itself (rather than just the C/AL language), whenever I got the functional design documents, I would put some critical thinking into it before jumping into development. I had received some nice documents to work on, but at the same time, I had received some very bad documents. Some functional documents would clearly state how they wanted Navision to work, and with what I knew from behind the scenes, that could cause some disasters in some areas of the system. Of course, I was not immune to disasters at all, some even caused by my own inexperieced self, of course, but with time and experience piling up, I was able to avoid issues more and more.\n\nI also got known to test my developments more thoroughly, which rendered less back-and-forth between me, the functional and the end-user. It was just a matter of time, that I started actually participating more and more on customer facing activities.\n\n2007 came, I was recently out of college living in São Paulo (one of the busiest cities in Latin America), when I decided I wanted to live with more quality of life. With this, I moved to Curitiba, in the south of Brazil, and unfortunately, there were absolutely zero opportunities of working in Navision in that part of the country. I needed to go back to old Visual Basic development, and I was part of the team that developed the Payroll System of Curitiba's City Hall. A few months after that, I was able to get some experience with C# and ASP.NET, since the city was modernizing some of its systems. My life in Curitiba didn't last long...\n\nEarly 2008, one of the Navision customers for my previous consulting job, had contacted me, offering a job to be an admin for their Navision 3.7 system. Even though I loved the quality of life in Curitiba, I dropped everything, and took this chance back, now in the countryside of São Paulo state (which was not as hectic as São Paulo city). I was so happy to be back to working with Nav, but this time, I was not supposed to develop. As a system adminitrator, I was now in charge of handling users (bugs, issues, training, permissions, etc...), and there was a team in Switzerland who was responsible for any developments and improvements needed.\n\nFor those who had worked with Brazil before, Brazil is crazy regulated by laws, and Navision","source":"_drafts/Detailed-Bio.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Detailed Bio (about me)\ndate: 2022-03-12 18:56:32\n---\n\n## Longer Bio...

Originally from Brazil, I consider myself fortunate that my parents were able to bring a computer home in the early 90’s, when I was 7 years old. Computers were not readily available in Brazil until the late 90’s, when prices started to become more accessible.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been interested on how things were made, and when I got a chance of playing with computers, I was always very interested in how computer programs (and games 😝) worked. At age of 11, I had already been playing with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase\">dBase III Plus</a> (a computer system that already had the concepts Business Central has like Tables, Forms and Reports), when a friend of the family briefly showed me how to take that dBase source code and write it in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)\">Clipper</a>, and compile it into an .EXE file. From that day on, my mind was permanently blown 😲.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/PAF/About-dBase.PNG\" alt=\"dBase III Plus\"></p>\n<p>I started finding all the different reasons to try to write programs. And the more data I could store about different entities, the happier I’d be 🤓. I wrote multiple pizza-order-taking software, VHS-rental software, software for my mom and my dad to work with on their businesses. My dad encouraged me by gifting me programming books, and my mom probably passed this programming gene to me by DNA, as she had taken a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol\">COBOL</a> course (in a paper-only format!) years prior to having me.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years, I got my hands on C, C++ and mostly on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)\">Visual Basic</a>, which had an easier way to connect to Databases.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/PAF/About-VB6.PNG\" alt=\"A screenshot of Visual Basic 6.0 running on Windows XP\"></p>\n<p>At age 14, I took a computer programming course on Databases and Data Modeling, which finally gave me some understanding on how data was stored and how entities (tables) related on different computer systems.</p>\n<p>While exploring Visual Basic, I got in touch with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access\">Microsoft Access</a> for creating Databases, but I never actually had programmed in it until a few years later, when my mom needed some piece of software to help her manage her Real Estate business. She needed an integrated software to control tenants, landlords, accounts payable and receivable, as well as receipt and check printing. And that was the very first mini-ERP that I had written from scratch. (P.S.: This software still lives, by the way, and I have tried multiple times to upgrade to newer technologies, but the users never adopted – tell me about users who don’t want to upgrade their systems! 😅)</p>\n<p>At around the same time, I went to college for Computer Science, and that’s when my knowledge in computer systems (and other areas in IT) multiplied infinitely. I had a chance of diving deep into programing languages and its basics, programing structures, database systems, computer systems, and even operating systems and compilers.</p>\n<p>Theeeeen… on my last year of college, I had been presented with an internship offer to learn “a new programming language” that was not very popular in Brazil, for one month, and after that, I was going to work with that programming language as a developer in implementation projects. The year was 2005, and that was the first time ever, that I had heard about Microsoft Business Solutions - Navision. I got my hands on it, when it was on version 3.7 in Brazil.</p>\n<p>And that’s when my love life begins with Navision…</p>\n<h2 id=\"Longer-Bio…-from-Navision-to-BC\"><a href=\"#Longer-Bio…-from-Navision-to-BC\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Longer Bio… from Navision to BC\"></a>Longer Bio… from Navision to BC</h2><p>As mentioned, I started working as a developer, a.k.a. a Technical Consultant, for a consulting company in Brazil. I was given that Navision 3.7 blue binder book, which had all the intricacies of Navision and C&#x2F;AL at the time. I was given 1 month to learn the basics, to explore the system, and then to start programing with it. At first, Navision C&#x2F;AL’s was a very odd programming language to me, since I was coming from languages such as Clipper, Visual Basic, Java and C. I had learned C&#x2F;AL was based in Pascal, but Pascal has never been in my repertoire before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/PAF/About-Pascal.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Free Pascal 3.2\"></p>\n<p>With time, however, I started enjoying Navision’s structure a lot: Reading and writing records to the database was pretty straight forward. All the helper functions that makes C&#x2F;AL for what it is, made the writing of Business Applications pretty easy and rapid. With time, I thought of writing all the systems I had ever written (including my mom’s Real Estate software), using Navision and C&#x2F;AL, but unfortunately, licensing was an issue that did not allow me to deploy any of my creations.</p>\n<p>I started enjoying the consulting life, as it was really fun to work on multiple industries and daily routines at the same time. As a technical consultant, however, my experiences were a bit more shielded by the leading functional consultant, and I didn’t get much customer-facing interaction as I would like (one bad stereotype I had from Computer Science students, was that they were all too much into their computers and had little to no social interactions – I didn’t want that to myself). With time, I had shown my boss, and my functional consultant peers that I was able of doing more than just developing…</p>\n<p>As I got more familiar with the Navision Application itself (rather than just the C&#x2F;AL language), whenever I got the functional design documents, I would put some critical thinking into it before jumping into development. I had received some nice documents to work on, but at the same time, I had received some very bad documents. Some functional documents would clearly state how they wanted Navision to work, and with what I knew from behind the scenes, that could cause some disasters in some areas of the system. Of course, I was not immune to disasters at all, some even caused by my own inexperieced self, of course, but with time and experience piling up, I was able to avoid issues more and more.</p>\n<p>I also got known to test my developments more thoroughly, which rendered less back-and-forth between me, the functional and the end-user.

Unfortunately, my idea didn't get enough push to be noted by Microsoft.\n\nTherefore, I decided to pursue this challenge myself. I went ahead and developed the **Advanced Find Entries**\n\n# How It Works\nTo start, make sure you're currently setup under the **Order Processor** role, and search for **Advanced Find Entries** on the Search Bar. Don't forget to add a bookmark!\n\n![Advanced Find Entries main page](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/HowItWorks-01.png)\n\nTo start searching, just type anything (e.g. a Sales Order No.) on the **Search Criteria** field, and click **Find** on the Actions ribbon.\n\n![After Search Results](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/HowItWorks-02.png)\n\nJust like standard **Find Entries**, BC will show a list of Tables that contains the **Search Criteria**, including in which _Fields_ the content was found. You can also drill down into the No. of Records, just like standard **Find Entries**.\n\nThe **Strict Search** flag is just a convenience feature: If set, **Advanced Find Entries** will only look for the exact **Search Criteria**. If not, it will search for the **Search Criteria** in any part of the field (this is the equivalent of applying a filter with '*' in the beginning and end of a filter).\n![Strict Search](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/HowItWorks-03.png)\n\nLet's see a few more details on what you can accomplish with **Advanced Find Entries** on the following sections...\n\n# Setup\nTo setup the **Advanced Find Entries**, search for **Advanced Find Entries Setup** on the Search Bar.\n\n![Advanced Find Entries Setup](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/Setup-01.png)\n\nOn the General area, marked in green, you can select which Profile you want to setup. On my first demo above, I ran a search over the **Order Processor** profile. I also provide demo data for the **Business Manager** and **Inventory Manager** Roles.\n\nOn the lines area, marked in blue, you will select which tables and fields you want the **Advanced Find Entries** to search on. On the setup above, for the **Order Processor** profile, I setup tables **Sales Header** (which includes *Quotes*, *Orders*, *Invoices*, *Credit Memos* and *Return Orders*), **Posted Shipments**, **Posted Invoices** and **Posted Credit Memos**.\n\nHere's a brief description on how you can setup each field on the lines:\n* **Table No.**: The Table No. for the Table you want to setup. Use the **Page Inspection** to help with that information, if you don't know Table Nos. by heart.\n\n* **Fields**: For each table, you must setup which fields the search engine will search over. If no fields are specified, the Table will be completely ignored. To setup fields, you can either drill down from the line, or click on **Fields** from the Actions ribbon.\n\n* **Stop on First Match**: Flag this if you want **Advanced Find Entries** to stop the search over a table once it finds the **Search Criteria** in any of the fields setup for that table. **❗Note**: If your searches are taking too long to execute, you may want to set this flag for the tables with most records.\n-- For an example on this field, refer to [Use Case 2 - Business Manager](#Use-Case-2-Business-Manager). \n\n* **Lookup Page Id Single**: Determine which Page Id that should open when you drill down into the **No. of Records**, when only 1 record is found. This is a nice feature to take the user straight into a Card, as opposed to taking the user to a List.\n\n* **Lookup Page Id Multiple**: The opposite from **Lookup Page Id Single**, you should specify here the Page Id that supports a List for this table.\n\nOnce everything is setup, you can test it by running the **Advanced Find Entries** action from the Actions ribbon. This will open the **Advanced Find Entries** page for the role that you are currently setting up. This is specially helpful when you're setting up a Role that is different that the one you're currently assigned to.\n\n![Advanced Find Entries for the current profile you're setting up](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/HowItWorks-04.png)\n\nKeep reading to see a few applications of the **Advanced Find Entries**\n\n# Use Case 1 - Sales Order Processor\n\n![Sales Order Processor Setup](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/SalesOrderProcessor.png)\nOn the Sales **Order Processor** role, we are more focused on _Documents Numbers_. Therefore, when customers call to inquire about their order, or maybe about a shipment or an invoice they received, it's valuable for Customer Sales Reps to be able to search by the reference number that the customer has on hand.\n\nWith this in mind, I setup the Order Processor role to search mainly on fields that can contain Document Nos.:\n* **Sales Header**\n  - No.\n  - Your Reference\n  - External Document No.\n* **Posted Sales Shipments**\n  - No.\n  - Customer PO No.\n  - Order No.\n  - External Document No.\n* **Posted Sales Invoices**\n  - No.\n  - Customer PO No.\n  - Order No.\n  - External Document No.\n  - Pre-Assigned No.\n* **Posted Sales Cr. Memos**\n  - No.\n  - Customer PO No.\n  - External Document No.\n  - Pre-Assigned No.\n  - Return Order No.\n\n# Use Case 2 - Business Manager\n\n![Business Manager Setup](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/BusinessManager.png)\nA **Business Manager** might be more interested in researching documents related to _Customer Names_, rather than _Document Numbers_. Therefore, I setup this profile to focus on the **Sales Orders**, **Posted Invoices** and **Posted Credit Memos**, and to search over fields that usually contain Names (Customer Names and Contact Names).\n\nFor this, I added the following 9 fields to tables **Sales Header**, **Posted Sales Invoice** and **Posted Credit Memo**:\n* Name\n* Name 2\n* Contact\n* Ship-to Name\n* Ship-to Name 2\n* Ship-to Contact\n* Bill-to Name\n* Bill-to Name 2\n* Bill-to Contact\n\nNote that for table **Sales Header**, I have flag **Stop on First Match** turned on. For this table, BC will start searching for the **Search Criteria** on the first field (sorted by Field No.), and once it finds any records matching the criteria, it will no longer search for that on the other fields, and, the Search Results will simply display the Table Name as a hit.\n\nWhen this flag is turned off (which is the default), even if BC finds records in a table, for one specific field, it will still keep on searching in the same table for the subsequent fields. Also, on the Search Results, it will display the specific Table Name and Field Name where records were found.\n\nSee the example below, when I search for **Cannon** on a BC Demo Database:\n\n![Stop on First Match](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/BusinessManager-StopFirstMatch.png)\n\nIn green, you can see that BC found 4 records containing the criteria **Cannon** in the Sales Header table, however, it is not clear in which field it was found. For this Use Case, knowing the field is not important.\n\nIn blue, you can see that BC found multiple records, but because **Stop on First Match** was turned off, BC kept on searching multiple times over the same table, looking for different fields, and indeed, it found **Cannon** over 3 different fields on Sales Invoice Header table, and over 2 different fields on the Sales Credit Memo table.\n\n⭐ **Tip** ⭐: Turn **Stop on First Match** on to increase performance when searching on tables with a large number of records.\n\n# Use Case 3 - Inventory Manager\n\n![Inventory Manager Setup](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/InventoryManager.png)\n\nThe Inventory Manager has more of an Item-centric search need. They are interested in finding out where an Item No. is currently used. Therefore, I added quite a few tables that can reference an Item No., and more than that, I also included Description fields on the search, so that the Inventory Manager can lookup items either by its Number, or by its Description.\n\nAs an example, check out the results that show up when I search for the good old \"Wheel\":\n![Search Criteria: Wheel](2022-03-14-Advanced-Find-Entries/InventoryManager-SearchWheel.png)\n\nAs an improvement to this profile, you could add fields from the Sales Lines, Purchase Lines, maybe Transfer Lines, and etc.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat's it for today.

For us, this means only one thing: 🟦**BC 20**🟦 **is here!** 🎉🎊🎈\n<!--more-->\n\nThese major upgrades usually get a lot of content, because they affect multiple areas that support the whole Business Central ecosystem. Not only we get tons of Functional (Application) upgrades, but we also get upgrades on Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, BC integration with Office 365, BC integration with Teams, the AL Language itself, and a quite a few tools for IT admins to manage this whole engine. ⚙\n\nOn this post, I'm going to be focusing more and highlighting some of the Functional (Application) upgrades coming to this version. **Tip**: On each section, you can click on that section's title to go right into the Microsoft documentation for that feature.\n\n---\n# (G/L) [Blocking Deletion of G/L Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/blocking-deletion-gl-accounts)\nA while ago, Microsoft introduced a field on the General Ledger Setup, called **Check G/L Acc. Deletion After**, that, upon trying to delete a G/L Account, if that account had entries after that date, BC would ask if the user really wanted to delete that G/L Account.

This will allow the project manager to route invoicing and the rendering of services accordingly. This will probably make life easier, if your Jobs are entered in BC way before they actually take place.

This will help a lot of developers and ISV companies better assist users having **mysterious** error messages.\n\nPlease note that this will **not** log error messages that are not really ERROR messages: If the program triggering the error message is actually triggering an **AL MESSAGE** function, you will still have some hard time assisting with debugging.\n\n---\nWell, that's it. I'm wrapping up here my review on the features that I wanted to highlight on the **major release of** 🟦**BC 20**🟦. It's not always that Microsoft has this many new exciting features, to be honest, but this release seems to be a very good one 🤩.\n\nThere are quite a few other improvements coming on this release that I did not add to my list, either because they were too technical, or because they were just minor to me.

(*Quick guide*: Go to the customer contact, select the Contact for the Company, **Functions** | **Create as** | **Vendor** (or **Customer** as needed)).\n\nWhen this is setup, then you will see 1 new field on your Customer Card (and 1 on the Vendor Card):\n![Customer Card - Balance As Vendor](2022-03-16-BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BalanceAs.png)\n\nLastly, on the Payment Journals, you will get a new action **Net Customer/Vendor Balances** that automatically create netting lines for Customers and Vendors that are linked.\n\n---\n# (Finance) [Improved and extensible Adjust Exchange Rates batch job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/improved-extensible-adjust-exchange-rates-batch-job)\nNot much on my daily routine, but it seems they are improving the **Adjust Exchange Rates** job in 2 new ways:\n* Possibility to preview the effect of the adjustments prior to posting\n* Possibility to determine how Dimensions will be assigned to Gains and Losses exchange adjustments G/L entries:\n  - Use dimensions from source entry\n  - Use dimensions from (Gains and Losses) G/L accounts\n  - Do not use dimensions\n\n---\n# (All Areas) [Finding documents and entries efficiently](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/finding-documents-entries-efficiently)\nWell, it seems Microsoft tried improving the basic **Find Entries** functionality, and it seems they will make a global shortcut now so that you can run the **Find Entries** page from anywhere you are in the system. This is pretty cool! It seems they are also improving the main page to include 3 types of searches:\n* **Documents**\n* **Business Contacts**\n* **Item References**\n\n![BC 20 Find Entries](2022-03-16-BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-FindEntries.png)\n\nI don't know exactly how broad the search will now be, so, let's see after it gets rolled out.\n\nIn the meantime, maybe you should check one of our repository items: [Advanced Find Entries](/2022/03/16/Advanced-Find-Entries/). It does what the Find Entries does, and a bit more. I'll maybe even consider taking over that new Global Shortcut 😆, who knows!\n\n---\n# (Manufacturing) [Fixed Quantity in product bills of materials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/fixed-quantity-product-bills-materials)\nIt will now be possible to assign a BOM Component with a Fixed Quantity, independent on how many items will be output!! 🎉\n\nThis will allow for Product Designers to include packaging and random-variable material on the Production BOM Components.\n\nThis improvement will be delivered throught a new option on field **Calculation Formula**: *Fixed Quantity*\n![Production BOM Component - Calculation Formula](2022-03-16-BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-FixedQty.png)\n\nWhen **Calculation Formula** is *Fixed*, the Production BOM Component Lines will calculate **Quantity** = **Quantity per**\n\n---\n# (Manufacturing) [Demo tool and demo data for manufacturing scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/demo-tool-demo-data-manufacturing-scenarios)\nMicrosoft will be bringing back demo data of the Manufacturing module, as an extension. It's not clear to me if they will install this by default with 🟦**BC 20**🟦, or if you need to download this Extension separately from the the product media (DVD) download.\n\n**Questioning Microsoft on this**\n\n---\n# (Demand Planning) [New UI for entering demand forecasts to add support for variant code and other improvements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/new-ui-entering-demand-forecasts-add-support-variant-code-other-improvements)\nIn demand planning, now you can:\n* **Not only Filter** the Demand View, **but also enter** Forecast **per Variant**\n  - This will show the same item multiple times, one for each variant 😲\n* **Enter Forecast per Location**\n  - This will show the same item multipel times, one for each location!! And it CAN be used in conjunction with the one for Variants 😲😲😲\n* **Store** Date, Location and Item **filters, as well as the Forecast Type**, so that you can close the page and open again at later point, and just pick up from where you left off 😲😲😲😲😲\n\n![New Demand Forecast Overview](2022-03-16-BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-DFEPreview.png)\n\n---\n# (Jobs) [Allow the sell-to and bill-to customers to be different for jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/allow-sell-to-bill-to-customers-be-different-jobs)\nI usually don't work with the Jobs module, to be honest, but this one sounds like an exciting new feature.\n\nJust like the regular Sales Order structure, BC will now have a **Sell-to** and a **Ship-to** customer information together with the **Bill-to** customer information that already existed. This will allow the project manager to route invoicing and the rendering of services accordingly. This will probably make life easier, if your Jobs are entered in BC way before they actually take place. PMs will no longer need to keep memory of these details, they will just be able to enter directly on the Job details.\n\nLast, but not least, 4 very important fields have also been added: **Your Reference**, **External Document No.**, **Payment Terms Code**, and **Payment Method Code**.\n\n---\n# (Jobs | Warehousing) [Support inventory pick and warehouse pick operations for jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/support-inventory-pick-warehouse-pick-operations-jobs)\nAgain, Jobs is not much of my area, but I know there had been some ISV's in the market that did exactly this: Provide Inventory support to the Jobs Module.\n\nNow, 🟦**BC 20**🟦 will be bringing Inventory Pick and Warehouse Pick operations into Jobs.\n\n---\n# (Plugins) [Shopify connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/shopify-connector)\nSounds promising, but I would be wary of this in the beginning. I'm sure there will be thousands of wrinkles (or maybe some huge creases 😕), to be ironed out with time.\n\n---\n# (Job Queues) [Delegated admin’s job queue entries are run by user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/delegated-admin-create-job-queue-entries-request-approval-licensed-user)\nIt shouldn't be this hard, but delegate accounts (aka Partner Accounts) still cannot run Job Queue Entries, however, Microsoft improved it a little bit, and now delegate users can create a Job Queue Entries, and request that a real licensed user runs it.\n\nI'm curious on how it's going to look like, but it sounds a bit better than what we have today. 🤞\n\n---\n# (Reports) [Excel Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/users-use-excel-design-layouts-reports)\nThis one also looks like a very nice feature: **Excel Layouts**.\n\nJust like **Word Layouts**, you will be able to create custom **Excel Layouts**, to add all the bells and whistles to it, such as sliders, diagrams, charts, pivot tables, etc. Then you will be able to import this layout back into Business Central, and see magic happens next time you export your repor to Excel.\n\nThere are no screenshots to entice us on the documentation for this feature, so, right now, I'll just be trying to picture it in my mind 😁💭\n\n---\n# (Telemetry) [Error dialogs are logged to telemetry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/telemetry-error-dialogs-are-logged-telemetry)\nThis is a bit of a technical topic, but I am very excited about this one.\n\nNow, when users get an Error message (logged with an **AL ERROR** function), admins will be able to review the telemetry entries to find where errors were triggered. This will help a lot of developers and ISV companies better assist users having **mysterious** error messages.\n\nPlease note that this will **not** log error messages that are not really ERROR messages: If the program triggering the error message is actually triggering an **AL MESSAGE** function, you will still have some hard time assisting with debugging.\n\n---\nWell, that's it. I'm wrapping up here my review on the features that I wanted to highlight on the **major release of** 🟦**BC 20**🟦. It's not always that Microsoft has this many new exciting features, to be honest, but this release seems to be a very good one 🤩.\n\nThere are quite a few other improvements coming on this release that I did not add to my list, either because they were too technical, or because they were just minor to me. Therefore, please make sure to review the original Microsoft [Release Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/) if you want to know every single new thing coming on 🟦**BC 20**🟦. 🍻","slug":"BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1","published":1,"updated":"2022-03-23T14:51:07.384Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl151pvun0007tbi46lujhire","content":"<div class=\"post-meta-container\" style=\"text-align:center\"><span class=\"post-meta-item\"><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/\">Dynamics 365 Business Central 2022 Wave 1 Release</a></span></div><p>Another April is coming, and Microsoft is getting all ready to deploy the 2022 Wave 1 Release for their whole Dynamics 365 family of products.

Not only we get tons of Functional (Application) upgrades, but we also get upgrades on Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, BC integration with Office 365, BC integration with Teams, the AL Language itself, and a quite a few tools for IT admins to manage this whole engine. ⚙</p>\n<p>On this post, I’m going to be focusing more and highlighting some of the Functional (Application) upgrades coming to this version. <strong>Tip</strong>: On each section, you can click on that section’s title to go right into the Microsoft documentation for that feature.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Blocking-Deletion-of-G-x2F-L-Accounts\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Blocking-Deletion-of-G-x2F-L-Accounts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Blocking Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/blocking-deletion-gl-accounts\">Blocking Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts</a></h1><p>A while ago, Microsoft introduced a field on the General Ledger Setup, called <strong>Check G&#x2F;L Acc. Deletion After</strong>, that, upon trying to delete a G&#x2F;L Account, if that account had entries after that date, BC would ask if the user really wanted to delete that G&#x2F;L Account. This is pretty useful for those countries that have a retention policy over the number of Years that some data must be stored. However, like many things in BC, this setting was not bullet proof: users could simply confirm they wanted to delete (maybe by mistake, whooops 😢), and then BC would delete the account. 💫</p>\n<p>Now, BC is introducing a flag (<strong>Block Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts</strong>) that, when turned on, will hard-block the deletion of such G&#x2F;L Accounts. If the deletion is really needed, an admin, or any other user with access to the <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> will be able to turn that off, proceed with the deletion, and turn that back on:<br><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BlockDeletion.png\" alt=\"Block Deletion of G/L Accounts on **General Ledger Setup**\"><span class=\"image-caption\">Block Deletion of G/L Accounts on **General Ledger Setup**</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Auto-accept-transactions-for-intercompany-journals\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Auto-accept-transactions-for-intercompany-journals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Auto-accept transactions for intercompany journals\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/intercompany-postings-have-auto-accept-transaction-enabled-intercompany-general-journals\">Auto-accept transactions for intercompany journals</a></h1><p>For those who use Intercompany Transactions, you understand the pain in having to click a thousand times to be able to send and receive documents and general journal lines between the different companies.</p>\n<p>Well, after a bit over 3 years (with the BC idea having been submitted in November 2018), Microsoft heard your pains, and they are revamping the Intercompany Experience. Now, just like Purchase and Sales documents, Journal Lines will be able to be automatically accepted on the recipient company.</p>\n<p>🔺<strong>Note</strong>🔺: This feature requires that you turn on a new Feature on the Feature Management. As stated on Microsoft’s documentation, if you don’t enable this new feature, you will see two search results for <strong>Intercompany Setup</strong>, <em>temporarily</em> until BC 23 (2023 Wave 2) 😲, when this feature is supposed to kick in automatically.</p>\n<p>On the new <strong>Intercompany Setup</strong> you will be able to setup a default <strong>Journal Template</strong> and <strong>Journal Batch</strong> for these transactions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-ICSetup.png\" alt=\"New IC Setup\"><span class=\"image-caption\">New IC Setup</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Block-VAT-and-General-Posting-Setups\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Block-VAT-and-General-Posting-Setups\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Block VAT and General Posting Setups\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/block-vat-general-posting-setups\">Block VAT and General Posting Setups</a></h1><p>Now it will be possible to post VAT Posting Setups and General Posting Setups!! 🎉</p>\n<p>If you block a Posting Setup, guess what happens: Users can’t post using that Posting Setup! 😎</p>\n<p>This way, you’ll be able to keep some old&#x2F;non-relevant posting setups for history purposes, and still prevent users from using it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BlockPostingSetup.png\" alt=\"New Gen.

So, why would this be a “new” feature? 😵  (US&#x2F;CA&#x2F;MX readers keep reading for 2 important notes on this! – <strong>Lump sum posting</strong> and <strong>how data will be migrated to new tables</strong>)</p>\n<p>Well, I’m glad to hear this has been promoted to a global level, because this is a pretty nice feature for Finance users. <strong>Bank Deposits</strong> make it easier to keep track of those lump-sum transactions that usually comes on Bank Statements as <em>“Deposit”</em> and nobody knows what-on-earth is inside that one big payment. Of course, finance users have found different ways of dealing with this, using the different journals available in BC, maybe some companies in some other countries even created ISVs for this (I don’t know, do you?), but now, you will have a better way of handling deposits.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Deposits have a document structure (with header and lines), so that you can enter general information on the header (such as <strong>Bank Account No.</strong>, <strong>Total Deposit Amount</strong>, <strong>Posting Date</strong> and <strong>Dimensions</strong>), and then identify on the lines, which documents are part of such deposit. Such lines can be checks from customers, cash sales revenues, or refunds from vendors. Prior to posting a deposit, the total amount on the lines must match the total deposit amount on the header.</p>\n<p>One feature that is new from the NA Version, is the <strong>Post as Lump Sum</strong> : **** Check what this does *****<br>**** Check how historical NA Deposits data will translate into new global BC Deposits ****</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Finance-Standardizing-the-bank-reconciliation-process-in-North-American-versions\"><a href=\"#Finance-Standardizing-the-bank-reconciliation-process-in-North-American-versions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Finance) Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions\"></a>(Finance) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions\">Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions</a></h1><p>This goes side by side with the previous section on Deposits.

This will allow the project manager to route invoicing and the rendering of services accordingly. This will probably make life easier, if your Jobs are entered in BC way before they actually take place.

This will help a lot of developers and ISV companies better assist users having <strong>mysterious</strong> error messages.</p>\n<p>Please note that this will <strong>not</strong> log error messages that are not really ERROR messages: If the program triggering the error message is actually triggering an <strong>AL MESSAGE</strong> function, you will still have some hard time assisting with debugging.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Well, that’s it. I’m wrapping up here my review on the features that I wanted to highlight on the <strong>major release of</strong> 🟦<strong>BC 20</strong>🟦. It’s not always that Microsoft has this many new exciting features, to be honest, but this release seems to be a very good one 🤩.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few other improvements coming on this release that I did not add to my list, either because they were too technical, or because they were just minor to me.

Not only we get tons of Functional (Application) upgrades, but we also get upgrades on Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, BC integration with Office 365, BC integration with Teams, the AL Language itself, and a quite a few tools for IT admins to manage this whole engine. ⚙</p>\n<p>On this post, I’m going to be focusing more and highlighting some of the Functional (Application) upgrades coming to this version. <strong>Tip</strong>: On each section, you can click on that section’s title to go right into the Microsoft documentation for that feature.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Blocking-Deletion-of-G-x2F-L-Accounts\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Blocking-Deletion-of-G-x2F-L-Accounts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Blocking Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/blocking-deletion-gl-accounts\">Blocking Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts</a></h1><p>A while ago, Microsoft introduced a field on the General Ledger Setup, called <strong>Check G&#x2F;L Acc. Deletion After</strong>, that, upon trying to delete a G&#x2F;L Account, if that account had entries after that date, BC would ask if the user really wanted to delete that G&#x2F;L Account. This is pretty useful for those countries that have a retention policy over the number of Years that some data must be stored. However, like many things in BC, this setting was not bullet proof: users could simply confirm they wanted to delete (maybe by mistake, whooops 😢), and then BC would delete the account. 💫</p>\n<p>Now, BC is introducing a flag (<strong>Block Deletion of G&#x2F;L Accounts</strong>) that, when turned on, will hard-block the deletion of such G&#x2F;L Accounts. If the deletion is really needed, an admin, or any other user with access to the <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> will be able to turn that off, proceed with the deletion, and turn that back on:<br><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BlockDeletion.png\" alt=\"Block Deletion of G/L Accounts on **General Ledger Setup**\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Auto-accept-transactions-for-intercompany-journals\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Auto-accept-transactions-for-intercompany-journals\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Auto-accept transactions for intercompany journals\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/intercompany-postings-have-auto-accept-transaction-enabled-intercompany-general-journals\">Auto-accept transactions for intercompany journals</a></h1><p>For those who use Intercompany Transactions, you understand the pain in having to click a thousand times to be able to send and receive documents and general journal lines between the different companies.</p>\n<p>Well, after a bit over 3 years (with the BC idea having been submitted in November 2018), Microsoft heard your pains, and they are revamping the Intercompany Experience. Now, just like Purchase and Sales documents, Journal Lines will be able to be automatically accepted on the recipient company.</p>\n<p>🔺<strong>Note</strong>🔺: This feature requires that you turn on a new Feature on the Feature Management. As stated on Microsoft’s documentation, if you don’t enable this new feature, you will see two search results for <strong>Intercompany Setup</strong>, <em>temporarily</em> until BC 23 (2023 Wave 2) 😲, when this feature is supposed to kick in automatically.</p>\n<p>On the new <strong>Intercompany Setup</strong> you will be able to setup a default <strong>Journal Template</strong> and <strong>Journal Batch</strong> for these transactions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-ICSetup.png\" alt=\"New IC Setup\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"G-x2F-L-Block-VAT-and-General-Posting-Setups\"><a href=\"#G-x2F-L-Block-VAT-and-General-Posting-Setups\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(G&#x2F;L) Block VAT and General Posting Setups\"></a>(G&#x2F;L) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/block-vat-general-posting-setups\">Block VAT and General Posting Setups</a></h1><p>Now it will be possible to post VAT Posting Setups and General Posting Setups!! 🎉</p>\n<p>If you block a Posting Setup, guess what happens: Users can’t post using that Posting Setup! 😎</p>\n<p>This way, you’ll be able to keep some old&#x2F;non-relevant posting setups for history purposes, and still prevent users from using it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BlockPostingSetup.png\" alt=\"New Gen.

So, why would this be a “new” feature? 😵  (US&#x2F;CA&#x2F;MX readers keep reading for 2 important notes on this! – <strong>Lump sum posting</strong> and <strong>how data will be migrated to new tables</strong>)</p>\n<p>Well, I’m glad to hear this has been promoted to a global level, because this is a pretty nice feature for Finance users. <strong>Bank Deposits</strong> make it easier to keep track of those lump-sum transactions that usually comes on Bank Statements as <em>“Deposit”</em> and nobody knows what-on-earth is inside that one big payment. Of course, finance users have found different ways of dealing with this, using the different journals available in BC, maybe some companies in some other countries even created ISVs for this (I don’t know, do you?), but now, you will have a better way of handling deposits.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Deposits have a document structure (with header and lines), so that you can enter general information on the header (such as <strong>Bank Account No.</strong>, <strong>Total Deposit Amount</strong>, <strong>Posting Date</strong> and <strong>Dimensions</strong>), and then identify on the lines, which documents are part of such deposit. Such lines can be checks from customers, cash sales revenues, or refunds from vendors. Prior to posting a deposit, the total amount on the lines must match the total deposit amount on the header.</p>\n<p>One feature that is new from the NA Version, is the <strong>Post as Lump Sum</strong> : **** Check what this does *****<br>**** Check how historical NA Deposits data will translate into new global BC Deposits ****</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Finance-Standardizing-the-bank-reconciliation-process-in-North-American-versions\"><a href=\"#Finance-Standardizing-the-bank-reconciliation-process-in-North-American-versions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Finance) Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions\"></a>(Finance) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/standardizing-bank-reconciliation-process-north-american-versions\">Standardizing the bank reconciliation process in North American versions</a></h1><p>This goes side by side with the previous section on Deposits. Microsoft will now push that North American users migrate to the standard Bank Reconciliation by BC 22 (2023 Wave 1). They claim this functionality has been improved to add features that existed only in the NA version, and, NA users will still have access to their old NA-style bank reconciliations.</p>\n<p>NA, keep an eye! 👁👁</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Finance-Change-default-company-bank-account-on-sales-and-service-documents\"><a href=\"#Finance-Change-default-company-bank-account-on-sales-and-service-documents\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Finance) Change default company bank account on sales and service documents\"></a>(Finance) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/change-default-company-bank-account-sales-service-documents\">Change default company bank account on sales and service documents</a></h1><p>Another exciting feature, it will now be possible to setup which Bank Instructions to print on Sales (and Service) documents.</p>\n<p>This means, that we no longer will need a report modification to show the differnt banking account information that the customer may have.</p>\n<p>With this modification, it will be possible to assign one default <strong>Bank Account</strong> per currency, and when <strong>Sales Orders</strong> are created, the <strong>Company Bank Account Code</strong> field will be automatically filled in based on the currency:<br><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-CompBankInfoSalesOrder.png\" alt=\"Sales Order - Company Bank Account Code\"></p>\n<p>This information transfer to the Posted Sales Invoice, and it will be possible for users to edit this in case they selected the wrong one at Sales Order level.</p>\n<p>Microsoft mentions that the printed documents were modified as well, but I haven’t had a chance to test myself to see how they’re looking. 🤞</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Finance-Consolidate-customer-and-vendor-balances\"><a href=\"#Finance-Consolidate-customer-and-vendor-balances\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Finance) Consolidate customer and vendor balances\"></a>(Finance) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/consolidate-customer-vendor-balances\">Consolidate customer and vendor balances</a></h1><p>Yes, you are reading this right: BC will now have some <strong>light</strong> functionality to help AP and AR talk better when it comes to Vendors-that-are-also-Customers or Customers-that-are-also-Vendors.</p>\n<p>For this to work, you need to setup a Customer as a Vendor (or the Vendor as a Customer), using the standard <strong>Contact Management</strong> functions that have existed in BC and NAV for quite a while. (<em>Quick guide</em>: Go to the customer contact, select the Contact for the Company, <strong>Functions</strong> | <strong>Create as</strong> | <strong>Vendor</strong> (or <strong>Customer</strong> as needed)).</p>\n<p>When this is setup, then you will see 1 new field on your Customer Card (and 1 on the Vendor Card):<br><img src=\"/2022/03/17/BC-20-Upgrades-BC-2022-Wave-1/BC20-BalanceAs.png\" alt=\"Customer Card - Balance As Vendor\"></p>\n<p>Lastly, on the Payment Journals, you will get a new action <strong>Net Customer&#x2F;Vendor Balances</strong> that automatically create netting lines for Customers and Vendors that are linked.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Finance-Improved-and-extensible-Adjust-Exchange-Rates-batch-job\"><a href=\"#Finance-Improved-and-extensible-Adjust-Exchange-Rates-batch-job\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Finance) Improved and extensible Adjust Exchange Rates batch job\"></a>(Finance) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/improved-extensible-adjust-exchange-rates-batch-job\">Improved and extensible Adjust Exchange Rates batch job</a></h1><p>Not much on my daily routine, but it seems they are improving the <strong>Adjust Exchange Rates</strong> job in 2 new ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possibility to preview the effect of the adjustments prior to posting</li>\n<li>Possibility to determine how Dimensions will be assigned to Gains and Losses exchange adjustments G&#x2F;L entries:<ul>\n<li>Use dimensions from source entry</li>\n<li>Use dimensions from (Gains and Losses) G&#x2F;L accounts</li>\n<li>Do not use dimensions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"All-Areas-Finding-documents-and-entries-efficiently\"><a href=\"#All-Areas-Finding-documents-and-entries-efficiently\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(All Areas) Finding documents and entries efficiently\"></a>(All Areas) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/finding-documents-entries-efficiently\">Finding documents and entries efficiently</a></h1><p>Well, it seems Microsoft tried improving the basic <strong>Find Entries</strong> functionality, and it seems they will make a global shortcut now so that you can run the <strong>Find Entries</strong> page from anywhere you are in the system.

This will allow the project manager to route invoicing and the rendering of services accordingly. This will probably make life easier, if your Jobs are entered in BC way before they actually take place. PMs will no longer need to keep memory of these details, they will just be able to enter directly on the Job details.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, 4 very important fields have also been added: <strong>Your Reference</strong>, <strong>External Document No.</strong>, <strong>Payment Terms Code</strong>, and <strong>Payment Method Code</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Jobs-Warehousing-Support-inventory-pick-and-warehouse-pick-operations-for-jobs\"><a href=\"#Jobs-Warehousing-Support-inventory-pick-and-warehouse-pick-operations-for-jobs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Jobs | Warehousing) Support inventory pick and warehouse pick operations for jobs\"></a>(Jobs | Warehousing) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/support-inventory-pick-warehouse-pick-operations-jobs\">Support inventory pick and warehouse pick operations for jobs</a></h1><p>Again, Jobs is not much of my area, but I know there had been some ISV’s in the market that did exactly this: Provide Inventory support to the Jobs Module.</p>\n<p>Now, 🟦<strong>BC 20</strong>🟦 will be bringing Inventory Pick and Warehouse Pick operations into Jobs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Plugins-Shopify-connector\"><a href=\"#Plugins-Shopify-connector\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Plugins) Shopify connector\"></a>(Plugins) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/shopify-connector\">Shopify connector</a></h1><p>Sounds promising, but I would be wary of this in the beginning. I’m sure there will be thousands of wrinkles (or maybe some huge creases 😕), to be ironed out with time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Job-Queues-Delegated-admin’s-job-queue-entries-are-run-by-user\"><a href=\"#Job-Queues-Delegated-admin’s-job-queue-entries-are-run-by-user\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Job Queues) Delegated admin’s job queue entries are run by user\"></a>(Job Queues) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/delegated-admin-create-job-queue-entries-request-approval-licensed-user\">Delegated admin’s job queue entries are run by user</a></h1><p>It shouldn’t be this hard, but delegate accounts (aka Partner Accounts) still cannot run Job Queue Entries, however, Microsoft improved it a little bit, and now delegate users can create a Job Queue Entries, and request that a real licensed user runs it.</p>\n<p>I’m curious on how it’s going to look like, but it sounds a bit better than what we have today. 🤞</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Reports-Excel-Layouts\"><a href=\"#Reports-Excel-Layouts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Reports) Excel Layouts\"></a>(Reports) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/users-use-excel-design-layouts-reports\">Excel Layouts</a></h1><p>This one also looks like a very nice feature: <strong>Excel Layouts</strong>.</p>\n<p>Just like <strong>Word Layouts</strong>, you will be able to create custom <strong>Excel Layouts</strong>, to add all the bells and whistles to it, such as sliders, diagrams, charts, pivot tables, etc. Then you will be able to import this layout back into Business Central, and see magic happens next time you export your repor to Excel.</p>\n<p>There are no screenshots to entice us on the documentation for this feature, so, right now, I’ll just be trying to picture it in my mind 😁💭</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"Telemetry-Error-dialogs-are-logged-to-telemetry\"><a href=\"#Telemetry-Error-dialogs-are-logged-to-telemetry\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"(Telemetry) Error dialogs are logged to telemetry\"></a>(Telemetry) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/dynamics365-business-central/telemetry-error-dialogs-are-logged-telemetry\">Error dialogs are logged to telemetry</a></h1><p>This is a bit of a technical topic, but I am very excited about this one.</p>\n<p>Now, when users get an Error message (logged with an <strong>AL ERROR</strong> function), admins will be able to review the telemetry entries to find where errors were triggered. This will help a lot of developers and ISV companies better assist users having <strong>mysterious</strong> error messages.</p>\n<p>Please note that this will <strong>not</strong> log error messages that are not really ERROR messages: If the program triggering the error message is actually triggering an <strong>AL MESSAGE</strong> function, you will still have some hard time assisting with debugging.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Well, that’s it. I’m wrapping up here my review on the features that I wanted to highlight on the <strong>major release of</strong> 🟦<strong>BC 20</strong>🟦. It’s not always that Microsoft has this many new exciting features, to be honest, but this release seems to be a very good one 🤩.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few other improvements coming on this release that I did not add to my list, either because they were too technical, or because they were just minor to me. Therefore, please make sure to review the original Microsoft <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/smb/\">Release Plan</a> if you want to know every single new thing coming on 🟦<strong>BC 20</strong>🟦. 🍻</p>"},{"title":"Developing with Docker","date":"2022-03-18T01:45:20.000Z","author":null,"hidden":true,"_content":"\nDevelopment with Docker\n\n-Download
