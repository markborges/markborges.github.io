    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was the second BC Idea I chose to implement, because I have also seen quite a few customers questioning this, especially former NAV customers that at some point had such a feature.</p><p>At the time of choosing this <a href="https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=ed7b8328-549c-ea11-8b71-0003ff68c1c1">BC Idea</a>, user <em>Melissa Reichenbacher</em> had collected 105 votes since its original posting back in 5&#x2F;22&#x2F;2020. <span id="more"></span> Let’s take a look at the request:</p><blockquote><p>Add a notification to alert users during order entry if the External Document No. entered on a new Sales Order already exists in an open Sales Order or posted Sales Invoice.</p><p>This is important to ensure a single customer order is not accidentally entered more than once. An additional enhancement would be the ability to set a default for the whole system with the ability to disable on a customer card.</p><footer><strong>@BCIdeas</strong><cite><a href="https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=ed7b8328-549c-ea11-8b71-0003ff68c1c1">Notification for duplicate External Documents in Sales</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p>If you also navigate through the comments, you will see how many people actually found this useful and added their own details to how they would like to see this working.</p><h3 id="Challenges-of-the-original-Navision-approach"><a href="#Challenges-of-the-original-Navision-approach" class="headerlink" title="Challenges of the original Navision approach"></a>Challenges of the original Navision approach</h3><p>When looking at this request, and remembering how Navision used to implement this, we definitely need to make improvements to this functionality. In the former days of Navision, if an External Document No. already existed for a customer, you simply could not reuse that External Document No. However, there were certain situations where users really needed to reuse that document No., and most of the times it was because they were just issuing the same invoice again (probably due to some error on the first invoice).</p><p>What happened then, is that users started to slightly manipulate the External Document No. in order to be able to “reuse” the original number: They added blank spaces to the beginning of the number, or they added dots or other symbols to the end of the number. With this, Navision would not recognized those manipulated numbers as existing, and users would be able to post the “same” External Document Number.</p><p>At the same time that users could reutilize numbers in a creative way, it created other challenges, such as trying to report off of that field.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t want to implement this the same way, so that we can have some quality over the External Document No…<br>⏳</p><h3 id="Implementation-Details-and-Settings"><a href="#Implementation-Details-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details and Settings"></a>Implementation Details and Settings</h3><p>The way I developed this feature, I created a global setting in the Sales &amp; Receivables Setup with 3 values:<br><img src="/PAF/Prevent-Duplicate-Ext-Doc-No/Prevent-Duplicate-External-Document-No-Settings.png"></p><ul><li><strong>No</strong>: Using the same External Document No. will not be an issue.</li><li><strong>Warning</strong>: If the user enters a duplicate <strong>Ext. Document No.</strong> (based on existing Sales Orders or Posted Sales Invoices), BC will throw a warning message, but it will let the user proceed.</li><li><strong>Error</strong>: If the user enters a repeated <strong>Ext. Document No.</strong> (based on existing Sales Orders or Posted Sales Invoices), BC will throw an error message and the user will not be able to proceed.</li></ul><p>The original poster also commented that it would be great if this setting could be done per customer as well, so I went ahead and added the same field on the Customer Card.</p><p><img src="/PAF/Prevent-Duplicate-Ext-Doc-No/Prevent-Duplicate-External-Document-No-Settings-Customer-Card.png"></p><p>Here, you have 4 options: To use the default value from the Sales &amp; Receivables Setup (and you shall see between parenthesis what is the current default value), and the other 3 possible options (No, Warning and Error).</p><h3 id="Setting-Warning"><a href="#Setting-Warning" class="headerlink" title="Setting: Warning"></a>Setting: Warning</h3><p>When you set BC to give you a warning, if you enter a duplicate Ext. Document Number, you shall see a message like the one below. You will be able to press Ok, and continue to use the same document number:<br><img src="/PAF/Prevent-Duplicate-Ext-Doc-No/PreventDuplicate-Warning.png"></p><h3 id="Setting-Error"><a href="#Setting-Error" class="headerlink" title="Setting: Error"></a>Setting: Error</h3><p>When you set BC to throw an Error, then you shall see a message like the one below, and you won’t be able to proceed until you enter a new Ext. Document No.:<br><img src="/PAF/Prevent-Duplicate-Ext-Doc-No/PreventDuplicate-Error.png"></p><h3 id="Warning-Microsoft-Implementation-⚠️"><a href="#Warning-Microsoft-Implementation-⚠️" class="headerlink" title="Warning: Microsoft Implementation ⚠️"></a>Warning: Microsoft Implementation ⚠️</h3><p>Since this idea has been posted, Microsoft has picked it up to be developed through their pilot open source contribution program, and they are coming up with their own implementation of this. As of now, their implementaiton will follow the Notification System pattern, where a blue notification is thrown at the top of the Sales Order document, which will probably suffice for most users. Since I’ve already developed this, I’m going to leave this implementation available, but you don’t have to enable it if you prefer to use Microsoft’s implementation.</p><h3 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h3><p>If you do enable this BC Idea, please use it at your own risk. Truthfully there’s not a lot of risk here but you have to be mindful of any potential conflicts with other existing extensions in your environment.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What do you do when you’re customizing processes that affect one of the most important tables in BC, the [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table, and you run into the dared <strong><em>CONSISTENT</em></strong> function error? ☠️</p><span id="more"></span><p>Customizing processes that touch the [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table is nothing new to Business Central, and a few specialized ISVs (or even Custom Extensions) also go through the same processes. Developers writing such extesions, more often than not, run <em>at least once</em> into this very known Consistent error message:</p><p><img src="/PAF/Check-GL-Inconsistencies/CheckGLInconsistencies-Error.png"></p><p>How to recover from this?</p><h3 id="Original-Solution-from-back-in-the-days…"><a href="#Original-Solution-from-back-in-the-days…" class="headerlink" title="Original Solution from back in the days…"></a>Original Solution from back in the days…</h3><p>Years and years ago, developers had the same issue, and I’m not sure exactly who came up with this solution, but I have some hints that <a href="https://forum.mibuso.com/discussion/comment/107946">this</a> might have been the original post in good old <a href="https://forum.mibuso.com/">Mibuso Forum</a>.</p><p>User <strong>ara3n</strong> suggested the following: To catch the CONSISTENT Error, we should create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/properties/devenv-singleinstance-property">Single Instance Codeunit</a> that will keep a Temporary table with G&#x2F;L Entries. The first time this Codeunit runs, it will enable the “tracking” of G&#x2F;L Entries. The second time it runs, it will show all the G&#x2F;L Entries that have been “tracked” so far.</p><p><strong>He modified the base code on Codeunit 12 - Gen. Jnl.-Post Line</strong>, so that if “tracking” was enabled, for every [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] that NAV would insert, a duplicate entry would be recorded in the temporary [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table kept on the Single Instance CU. With this, it was possible to intercept any records being inserted in the [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table using standard NAV Posting Codeunits.</p><p>If users ran into a CONSISTENT function error message, even though their original transaction was rolled back, <strong>the records in the temporary record were not</strong>. So, in order to try to detect which G&#x2F;L entries were faulty, users would:</p><ul><li>Run the Single Instance CU, from the Object Designer, to enable “tracking”</li><li>Run the posting process with issues</li><li>Run into the CONSISTENT function error message</li><li>Run the Single Instance CU again to view the “faulty” G&#x2F;L Entries</li></ul><p>With this, it was pretty easy to detect what entries had the wrong amounts in it, or, if a full leg was missing from the balances.</p><h3 id="BC-Repositories-Solution"><a href="#BC-Repositories-Solution" class="headerlink" title="BC Repositories Solution"></a>BC Repositories Solution</h3><p>With BC’s architecture using Event Subscribers, the actual implementation becase a lot easier. I still created a Single Instace Codeunit for the same two original reasons:</p><ul><li>Set Tracking on or off</li><li>Keep the temporary [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] records</li></ul><p>Then, all I needed to do in terms of intercepting CONSISTENT issues, I just subscribed to the [e:OnAfterFinishPosting] event on [c:Gen. Jnl.-Post Line] codeunit. The signature for this event is as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">local procedure &quot;Gen. Jnl.-Post Line_OnAfterFinishPosting&quot;(var GlobalGLEntry: Record &quot;G/L Entry&quot;; var GLRegister: Record &quot;G/L Register&quot;; var IsTransactionConsistent: Boolean; var GenJournalLine: Record &quot;Gen. Journal Line&quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Among others, we are focused only on the following parameters:</p><ul><li>[e:GlobalGLEntry]: a copy of the [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table with the new records</li><li>[e:GLRegister]: a copy of the [t:G&#x2F;L Register] table with the new records</li><li>[e:IsTransactionConsistent]: a boolean indicating if the [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] table is balanced or not</li></ul><p>With these parameters available, the only task left is to check if [e:IsTransactionConsistent] is false or not, and then store the faulty [t:G&#x2F;L Entry] records, if the single instance codeunit is set to track consistency issues.</p><h3 id="How-to-Use-this-Utility"><a href="#How-to-Use-this-Utility" class="headerlink" title="How to Use this Utility"></a>How to Use this Utility</h3><p>From the <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=61501"><strong>BC Repo - Utilities</strong></a> page, search for utility “Check G&#x2F;L Inconsistencies” from the list, and hit action [a:Launch]. You will be presented with the following page:</p><p><img src="/PAF/Check-GL-Inconsistencies/CheckGLInconsistencies-Page.png"><br><em>BC Repo - Utilities page</em></p><ul><li>Hit [a:Start Tracking] if you would like to start recording faulty transactions</li><li>Hit [a:Stop Tracking] if you already finished your analysis. <strong>Note:</strong> Tracking will be automatically disabled once your web session dies.</li><li>Hit [a:Refresh Entries] if you recorded transactions already and they’re not showing on the page yet.</li></ul><p>Use the fields at the bottom of the page to detect if Tracking is enabled or not, as well as to check if the Balances are correct. Most likely, Total Debits and Total Credits will not be matching, and from the G&#x2F;L Entries, you shall find the reason for the unbalance.</p><h3 id="Out-of-Box-Inconsistency-Reports"><a href="#Out-of-Box-Inconsistency-Reports" class="headerlink" title="Out of Box Inconsistency Reports"></a>Out of Box Inconsistency Reports</h3><p>In the past, both VAT calculations and Currency Exchange calculations were prone to triggering the CONSISTENT function error. To this date, it still happens under a few situations, and that’s mostly due to rounding issues more than anything.</p><p>I don’t usually run these 2 tasks, but from what I read in the BC source code, there is a function [e:ShowInconsistentEntries] <a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Finance/GeneralLedger/Posting/GenJnlPostLine.Codeunit.al#L273">[icon:open_in_new]</a> that is used by both [r:Adjust Exchange Rates] (<a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Finance/Currency/AdjustExchangeRates.Report.al#L33">Report [icon:open_in_new]</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Finance/Currency/ExchRateAdjmtProcess.Codeunit.al#L29">Codeunit [icon:open_in_new]</a>) and [r:Calc. and Post VAT Settlement] <a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Finance/VAT/Reporting/CalcandPostVATSettlement.Report.al#L21C4-L21C5">[icon:open_in_new]</a> processes.</p><br><h3 id="That’s-it-🎉"><a href="#That’s-it-🎉" class="headerlink" title="That’s it! 🎉"></a>That’s it! 🎉</h3><p>If you liked this <strong>BC Repo Utility</strong>, this development, or if you have questions or comments about this, don’t hesitate to react and&#x2F;or post on the discussion below (you will need a GitHub account).</p><h3 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h3><p>If you use this <strong>BC Repo Utility</strong>, please use it at your own risk.

    <title>BC Idea | Disable printing for Purchase Order under Pending Approval Status</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This original <a href="https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=c8cad776-56b3-e911-b083-0003ff68a4d2">idea</a> posted by user <em>YOKE MAY TANG</em> on 7&#x2F;31&#x2F;2019 collected a total 135 votes at the time of development and I chose this one to be my first development because of its simplicity considering the total vote count.</p><span id="more"></span><p>In the original post, the user requests:</p><blockquote><p>Would like to prevent PO to be printed&#x2F;emailed to vendor while the PO is under Pending Approval.</p><footer><strong>@BCIdeas</strong><cite><a href="https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=c8cad776-56b3-e911-b083-0003ff68a4d2">Disable printing for Purchase Order under Pending Approval Status</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p>It’s a simple statement, and it seems to be pretty straight forward, right? But it does have a few caveats to be considered.</p><p>When users told me in the past they would not like BC to behave in a certain way until an approval process has cleared, it was mostly because they didn’t want users taking a shortcut in the process.</p><p>In this request, if we take it literally, it would be very easy to create a block (maybe an Error message?) to prevent the user from printing the Purchase Order document if Status equals “Pending Approval”. But if you really analyze this further, only blocking this for “Pending Approval” status wouldn’t make much sense…</p><p>What if the user simply printed the Purchase Document BEFORE requesting an approval? Then this block would be pretty useless, right? ⌛</p><br><h3 id="Implementation-Details"><a href="#Implementation-Details" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Details"></a>Implementation Details</h3><p>Having this in mind, what makes more sense, is to actually prevent the printout if the status is <em>not released</em>. This means that even POs with status “Pending Prepayment” will be blocked from printing the Purchase Order document.</p><p>Having established that premise, we now need to then determine, in the code, where will we put this block?</p><p>In some of the comments, one user mentioned that it would be pretty easy to implement this block directly on the report, but I see one problem with that approach: a large majority of the customers customize the [r:Purchase Order] report. Most of them, yes, they reuse the original report as a base, and some of them, might probably be using Report Extensions. What about that small percentage that are developing the [r:Purchase Order] report from scratch, or even migrating those from a previous Business Central version…? Therefore, there’s a chance that the developer customizing the Purchase Order document will forget to put this block in place, and the whole feature goes down the drain.</p><p>Therefore, I chose to actually subscribe to 3 specific events:</p><ul><li><strong>Table [t:Purchase Header]:[e:OnBeforePrintRecords]</strong><a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Purchases/Document/PurchaseHeader.Table.al#L7214">[icon:open_in_new]</a><ul><li>This one is triggered right before BC tries to print the [r:Purchase Order] report</li></ul></li><li><strong>Table [t:Purchase Header]:[e:OnBeforeSendRecords]</strong><a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Purchases/Document/PurchaseHeader.Table.al#L7209C9-L7209C10">[icon:open_in_new]</a><ul><li>This one is triggered right before BC tries to send the [r:Purchase Order] report by e-mail</li></ul></li><li><strong>Codeunit [c:Document-Print]:[e:OnDoPrintPurchaseHeaderToDocumentAttachmentOnBeforeRunSaveAsDocumentAttachment]</strong><a href="https://github.com/StefanMaron/MSDyn365BC.Code.History/blob/7edfe60e4c08f6b8cf7d672a78c1ecd8a54332b3/BaseApp/Source/Base%20Application/Foundation/Reporting/DocumentPrint.Codeunit.al#L1082">[icon:open_in_new]</a><ul><li>This one is triggered while BC is trying to attach the PO to the PO itself</li></ul></li></ul><p>With this, no matter if you use the standard out-of-box report, or if you use a custom report on the Report Selections, our block will most likely work as expected, when you trigger does actions from the PO Card or the PO List.</p><h3 id="Settings"><a href="#Settings" class="headerlink" title="Settings"></a>Settings</h3><p>To enable this BC Idea, visit the <a href="https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=61500"><em>BC Idea Feature Management</em></a> page and search for the original title on the list. </p><p>Once you enable it, you will find a new setting under Purchase &amp; Payables Setup (under FastTab <em>BC Ideas Features</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>Disable Printing Unreleased POs</strong><ul><li>This setting will be enabled by default when you activate the feature, and it will prevent users from printing&#x2F;emailing&#x2F;attaching the PO document, if its status is not released.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="/PAF/Disable-Printing/Disable-Printing-PPSetup.png"><br><strong><em>Purchase &amp; Payables Setup</em></strong></p><p>To disable this, you can either disable the setting on the P&amp;P Setup, or you can disable the BC Idea feature altogether.</p><p>If you need to set permissions on who can enable or disable this feature, you need to restrict this permission on the Purchase &amp; Payables setup.</p><h3 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h3><p>If you do enable this BC Idea, please use it at your own risk.

For each idea that I develop, I plan on writing a post where I’ll go over the challenges and decision-making thoughts for choosing certain designs, as well as sharing a little bit of the development process.</p><p>You can read a bit more about who I am on the <a href="/About">About</a> page.</p><p>If you would like to download the current version of the <strong>BC Repositories - BC Ideas and Utilities</strong> app, please check the <a href="/Download">Download</a> link, but don’t forget to visit the <a href="/Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> section for more details.</p><p>If you’d like to contact me, please review the links on the <a href="/About#About-the-Author">About</a> page.</p><h3 id="BC-Repo-Utilities-and-Other-Posts"><a href="#BC-Repo-Utilities-and-Other-Posts" class="headerlink" title="BC Repo Utilities and Other Posts"></a>BC Repo Utilities and Other Posts</h3><p>I also plan on posting BC Utilities made for Admin, End Users, Functional and Technical Consultants, for tasks that I see being repeated over and over again in my projects. I’m also going back to being more active on the social groups for Nav and BC, and whenever I find a topic I’d like to expand more on, it will probably turn into a post.</p><p>So, just like any blog, there will be a little bit of everything, until it gets its own personality… or until it fizzles, who knows 🤷‍♂️.</p><h3 id="Microsoft’s-Pilot-GitHub-Contribution-to-BC’s-BaseApp"><a href="#Microsoft’s-Pilot-GitHub-Contribution-to-BC’s-BaseApp" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft’s Pilot GitHub Contribution to BC’s BaseApp"></a>Microsoft’s Pilot GitHub Contribution to BC’s BaseApp</h3><p>Please note that Microsoft currently has their own Pilot program where developers can freely contribute to BC’s BaseApp, through GitHub interactions.</p><p>This blog is not connected with that initiative. Instead, it will serve as an additional resource for users to see their BC Ideas implemented, until Microsoft pick them up to be part of the official product release.</p>]]></content>
